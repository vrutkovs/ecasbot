EC AntiSpam bot for the Telegram messenger will automatically detect and block multimedia messages, links from the newly joined users, some common spam bots and users who added them to super-groups.

You will need to get an API token from @BotFather and give it to this installer. It will be saved and forwarded to bot using environment variables.
